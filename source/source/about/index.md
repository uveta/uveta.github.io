Hi, my name is Uro≈°, living and developing from Prague, Czech Republic. Been working as a developer since 2007. Even though I encountered a lot of technologies on my journey, I am mostly engaged in .NET world. I see Azure and containers as a natural progression of that path, hence I fully embraced them in the last couple of years.

Besides being a full-time developer and system architect, I am a software quality evangelist, teacher, as well as student. Constantly improving myself and expanding knowledge of volatile tech world is what drives me day to day. I tend to spread that attitude to people I work with as well.

I nitpick pull requests to death. Consider yourself warned :smile:
